<br>

# How it works

- ## Download the [dataset](#dataset-1) content and unzip it

- ## Import the `images` folder and `annotations.json` file to the `/dataset/` directory

- ## Run the `main.py` file to train the model and generate the file (**meu_modelo.h5**)

- ## Run the `predict.py` file to predict the object's capacity from its image.
<br>

# How to help increase the dataset

- ## Add the object's image whose capacity is between 100 milliliters and 2 liters to the `/dataset/images` directory following the filename's pattern
- ## Add the filename and its capacity to the `/dataset/annotations.json` file following the past examples.
- ## Follow the instructions of the [How it works](#how-it-works) topic
- ## It's working properly? Update the `images` folder and `annotations` file in [Google Drive's link](#images)
